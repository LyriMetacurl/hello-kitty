# hello-kitty

Hello Kitty is a copy of Albert Sweigart's "spritesAndSounds.py" but with Hello Kitty eating mice. Sounds, sprites and music have been changed appropriately. This works much slower than the original but is still a bit of weird fun. It requires installation of Python with the pygames module.
